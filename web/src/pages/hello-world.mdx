# Hello, world!

First post is going to be about the flex box layout and the different ways we can control the outer margin. I want to give a number of options.

There is no one _right_ answer to these things. Rather I want to show the different ways we can solve a problem.

My approach to these has changed over time. I used to give each flex item a container and put a small border around each one.

You can improve this by adding a nice colored background so the margin are not broken.

Negative margins are now the way to go though;

## Heading level two

> Here is a blockquote

### Heading level three

Here comes a level three heading following a level two heading

## Here comes this

### Here comes the level three!

Can I have a figcaption?
